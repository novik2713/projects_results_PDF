Hey there! 👋 Check out my GitHub for some cool project final presentations. 
I've poured my heart into these, showcasing my analytical and presentation skills. Excited to share my journey and the awesome work I've done. 
Let me know what you think! 🚀

✔️ Project 1: Fundamental Graphs & Tableau
An exploration into the realm of Tableau and fundamental graphs. This project serves as a precursor to forthcoming Python-centric assignments, offering foundational insights.

Btw, I spiced it up a bit. Created a fake email from my "boss" and answered it with my presentation. Real-world vibes, you know?🚀😜
🎥Moreover, I incorporated an element of engagement by concluding the project with "Successful Cases" – a movie examples featuring varying durations, genres, and associated minimum costs per minute.📺
*The project was implemented during 1 week out of 21 at Code Academy Berlin 'Data Analytics and Machine Learning Program'*

✔️Project 2: BlueBerry Winery
